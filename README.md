# Stack-Queue-Palindrome-Checker
Program takes a predetermined/maximum number of characters for the user to test if a 
word is a palindrome. The user's word is inserted into a stack data structure and a
queue data structure to start and is then tested for palindrom qualities. Upon testing 
the user's word, the user is shown the results of the palindrom test.
